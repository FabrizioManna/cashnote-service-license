# Welcome to the GraphQL API for managing software licenses!

Our API provides a flexible and powerful way to manage software licenses, ensuring compliance and facilitating the distribution of licenses to end-users.

Using GraphQL as our query language, our API allows developers to retrieve license information, generate new licenses, and manage license renewals and expirations.

With our API, you can easily integrate license management into your software application, simplifying the process for end-users and providing greater visibility and control for administrators.

Our API is built with a focus on security, ensuring that license information is kept safe and secure at all times.

Getting started with our API is easy. Simply sign up for an API key, and start exploring our documentation to see how you can integrate license management into your application.

Thank you for choosing our GraphQL API for managing software licenses. We're excited to see how you will use it to build powerful software applications. <b>Is a microservice for an complete software the name Cashnote<b>
